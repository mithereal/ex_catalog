# ExCatalog

** A General E-commerce Catalog System **

Think of this like an old school paper mail in catalog, we dont need all the fluff (extra db tables etc) as in in most ecommerce implementations, this is just a catalog, decoupled from inventory management.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `ex_catalog` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_catalog, ">= 0.0.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/ex_catalog>.
